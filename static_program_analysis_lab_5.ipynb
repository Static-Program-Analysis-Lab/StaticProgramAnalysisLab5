    "## &#128221; Exercise 1: Introduction to Symbolic Execution\n",
    "\n",
    "### &#127919; Objective\n",
    "To introduce you to the concept of symbolic execution and demonstrate how to implement it in Python for program analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### &#128161; Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Symbolic execution is a sophisticated program analysis technique that explores multiple execution paths in a program by treating its inputs as symbolic variables instead of concrete values. This extensive exploration is vital for various applications including bug discovery, test case generation, and security analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Elements:\n",
    "- **Symbol**: A variable used to symbolize an unknown value. During program execution, symbols replace concrete values.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Constraint**: A mathematical condition that is imposed on symbols. For instance, `x + 5 > 10` can be considered a constraint on the symbolic variable `x`.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Path Constraint**: A set of constraints that, when satisfied, make a particular execution path possible. These constraints accumulate at conditional branches like `if-else` statements in the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Symbolic Variable**: A special variable that takes on symbolic values during execution, aiding in the formation of constraints and path constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Solver**: An essential component in symbolic execution that attempts to find values for symbolic variables that satisfy the path constraints. Solvers like Z3 can be used to verify if a particular path is feasible or to find specific inputs that can trigger a particular path.\n",
    "\n",
    "The exercise will guide you through the development of a simplified symbolic execution engine that can handle arithmetic operations and conditional branches in Python code. This engine will not only generate but also solve path constraints using a solver, thereby offering an in-depth understanding of how different conditions affect program behavior. The solver's role is crucial here, as it helps in validating the feasibility of paths and can even be used for tasks like automatic test case generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### &#10145; Task\n",
    "\n",
    "Implement a basic symbolic execution engine that will explore both branches of a given if-else statement in Python code, assuming symbolic variables for the inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### &#128221; Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use the `ast.parse` function to parse a simple Python script with an `if-else` statement into an AST.\n",
    "2. Create a `SymbolicExecutor` class that will visit each `ast.If` node and simulate the symbolic execution for both the true and false branches.\n",
    "3. Apply your `SymbolicExecutor` class to the AST obtained in step 1 using the `visit` method.\n",
    "4. Generate constraints for both the true and false branches of the `if-else` statement based on the conditions.\n",
    "5. Output the constraints for both paths, effectively demonstrating symbolic execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "==> For simplification, you may assume that the script only contains arithmetic operations (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`) and simple `if-else` statements. Your symbolic execution engine should be able to generate constraints like `x + y > 10` or `x * 2 < y`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This exercise will deepen your understanding of symbolic execution, enabling you to appreciate its potential for advanced program analysis tasks."

    "    \n",

    "    - This function will take a dictionary of path constraints and a dictionary of symbolic variables as parameters.\n",
    "    - Utilize the Z3 solver to find a model that satisfies these constraints.\n",
    "    - Store the satisfying model for each node in a dictionary and return it.\n",

    "4. **Constraints to Z3 Expressions**: \n",
    "    - Translate each symbolic constraint to a Z3 expression using `to_z3_expr`.\n",
    "    - Combine multiple constraints using logical AND (`And`) and OR (`Or`) operators from Z3.\n",

    "    - Push and pop the solver context appropriately to avoid conflicts between different sets of constraints.\n",
